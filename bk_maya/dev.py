# ── Client source (see blendkit_client_build / download_client_release) ─────
# The Go client lives in its own repository, embedded here as the ``bk_client``
# submodule (see .gitmodules). Its Go sources are at ``bk_client/client`` and its
# version is ``bk_client/client/VERSION``. The submodule's own ``dev.py build``
# cross-compiles every platform and bundles the binaries + tools + icons into a
# single ``bk_client.zip`` release archive.
#
# Build policy:
#   • ``build``   (local / debug) delegates the compile to the submodule's
#     ``dev.py`` and unpacks the resulting ``bk_client.zip`` into the add-on, so
#     client changes are exercised end-to-end. Binaries are UNSIGNED.
#   • ``release`` downloads the *signed* ``bk_client.zip`` published on the
#     bk_client GitHub releases (https://github.com/BlenderKit/bk_client),
#     because code-signing/notarization happens in that repo's CI. Pass
#     ``--client-build <bk_client.zip>`` (or ``$BLENDKIT_CLIENT_BINARIES``) to use
#     a locally downloaded signed bundle instead of hitting the network.
# The env-var lets CI inject a path without changing the command line.

Blendkit for Maya — version {version} ({channel})
================================================================

This package is self-contained: it bundles the Python code, all required
third-party libraries, and the Blendkit client binaries for every platform.
You do NOT need to pip-install anything or run any setup.

After unzipping you have two items:

    blendkit.mod      <- the Maya module file
    blendkit/         <- the module folder (Python + client binaries)

KEEP THESE TWO TOGETHER. Copy BOTH into one of Maya's "modules" folders:

  Windows : C:\\Users\\<you>\\Documents\\maya\\modules
  macOS   : ~/Library/Preferences/Autodesk/maya/modules
  Linux   : ~/maya/modules

  (Create the "modules" folder if it does not exist. A version-specific
   folder such as .../maya/2026/modules also works.)

So the result looks like:

  .../maya/modules/blendkit.mod
  .../maya/modules/blendkit/

Then:

  1. Start (or restart) Maya.
  2. Open Windows > Settings/Preferences > Plug-in Manager.
  3. Find "maya_plugin.py", tick "Loaded" (and "Auto load" to keep it on).
  4. A "Blendkit" menu appears in the main menu bar.

To update: replace both "blendkit.mod" and the "blendkit" folder with the
newer ones and restart Maya. The installed version is shown in the Plug-in
Manager and under Blendkit > About.

To uninstall: untick the plug-in, then delete "blendkit.mod" and the
"blendkit" folder from the modules directory.

    The ``.mod`` lives *next to* (not inside) the ``blendkit/`` folder because
    Maya resolves the module path on its ``+ blendkit <ver> blendkit`` line
    relative to the ``.mod`` file's own directory. Users drop BOTH items into a
    Maya ``modules`` directory.

    - install_at: list of Maya ``modules`` directories. Both ``blendkit.mod``
      and the ``blendkit/`` folder are copied into each location.
    - include_tests: also copy the repo-level ``tests/`` directory into the build.
    - clean_dir: directory to wipe after building (e.g. cached client binaries
      under the user's Blendkit data dir).
    - client_source: how to assemble ``client/``. ``"build"`` compiles the
      client locally from the submodule (unsigned, debug); ``"download"`` pulls
      the signed ``bk_client.zip`` from the bk_client GitHub releases;
      ``"local"`` unpacks a locally supplied ``bk_client.zip`` (``client_bundle``).
    - client_bundle: path to a local signed ``bk_client.zip`` (or a directory
      containing it) used when ``client_source == "local"``.
    - release_tag: optional bk_client release tag for ``client_source ==
      "download"``. When omitted, the pinned minor series (``CLIENT_VERSION`` in
      ``bk_maya/core/global_vars.py``) is resolved to its newest patch release.
    - channel: release channel (``stable`` / ``alpha`` / ``dev``) — controls the
      ``-alpha`` suffix and is recorded in the built package.
    - version: explicit full version override; otherwise computed from
      ``BASE_VERSION`` + a UTC ``YYMMDDHHmm`` stamp.
    - python_targets: one or more keys of ``PYTHON_BUILD_TARGETS``. Each target
      re-vendors ``lib/`` for its Maya interpreter and emits its own zip
      (``…-py39.zip`` / ``…-py311.zip``); ``"current"`` keeps the unsuffixed
      name. Pass ``("3.9", "3.11")`` to ship both Maya interpreter builds.
